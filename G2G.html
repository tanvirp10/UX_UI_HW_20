        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>The main objective of my project is to develop a mobile design for the G2G website. G2G serves as an online marketplace specializing in the trading of game items, accounts, and currency. As an avid gamer myself, this project holds personal significance to me, as I frequently engage with video games during my leisure time and have often relied on the G2G platform for acquiring various gaming necessities. By creating a mobile design for G2G, I aim to enhance the user experience and accessibility of the website, ensuring that fellow gamers can conveniently engage in secure transactions and easily find the gaming resources they require.</p>
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>In this project, I employed a methodology that involved conducting a thorough analysis of G2G's competitors and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the website. Drawing from my experience as a UX Designer, I assessed G2G's website as highly interactive and visually appealing, thus choosing to retain certain design elements in the mobile version.</p>
        <img src="images/methodology.jpg" style="height:250px;">
        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <h3>User Research Plan</h2>
        <p>To commence the user research phase, I craft a thorough user research plan with the primary goal of precisely pinpointing the specific target audience I sought to connect with. In this case, the identified target audience falls within the age range of 18-25 and comprises individuals who hold steady employment and actively participate in online gaming with a circle of friends.</p>
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>After formulating the user research plan, the next step in my methodology involved conducting a thorough competitor analysis to ascertain the key rivals that G2G is contending with. The analysis revealed Steam and PlayerAuction as the two primary competitors in this domain. Through a detailed examination of these competitors, I identified a notable weakness in G2G's seller verification process, particularly concerning mobile authentication. In comparison to both Steam and PlayerAuction, G2G lagged behind in implementing a reliable seller verification system through mobile authentication.  I discovered that G2G excelled in the creation of superior trade offers when compared to Steam. This strength enabled G2G to provide more enticing and competitive trade opportunities for users, thereby distinguishing itself as a preferred choice for gamers seeking favorable deals.</p>
        <h1>Ideation & Development</h1>
        <h3>Develop</h3>
        <p>As I transitioned into the development phase, I initiated the creation of wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes to provide a visual representation of the potential mobile design for G2G. To generate ideas and inspiration, I extensively explored similar apps and platforms within the gaming and e-commerce domains.</p>
        <h3>User Testing</h1>
        <p>To assess the accessibility of the app, I conducted two usability tests involving potential users. Overall, the users responded positively to the visual aspects of the app, indicating that the design was visually appealing and engaging. In terms of accessibility, the majority of users found the app to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. However, one user did express difficulty in reading the text on the gift card page, mentioning that the font size was too small and it hindered visibility. This feedback shed light on an area for improvement regarding text legibility and size.</p>
        <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
        <p>The primary objective during this phase was to implement minor tweaks and improvements to enhance the overall user experience. To ensure consistency and familiarity, I carefully extracted elements from the G2G website and incorporated them into the mobile design. By adopting similar visual styles, color schemes, and branding elements, the mobile app would maintain a cohesive and recognizable identity, creating a seamless transition for users between the website and mobile experience. The integration of elements from the G2G website into the mobile design helped establish familiarity and cohesiveness, while the iterative tweaks and improvements aimed to enhance the overall usability, aesthetics, and user satisfaction with the final high-fidelity prototype.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>In conclusion, undertaking this passion project has been an enriching experience that has contributed to my growth as a UX designer. The opportunity to create a mobile design for the G2G website allowed me to explore various aspects of user research, competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. Overall, I am proud of the outcomes achieved through this project and feel more equipped to tackle future design challenges. I am excited to apply the knowledge and skills gained here to create even more impactful and user-centric designs in the future, contributing positively to the field of UX design.</p>
